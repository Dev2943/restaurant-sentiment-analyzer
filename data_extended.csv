Absolutely fantastic dining experience! The pasta was cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable. Our waiter was knowledgeable about wine pairings and made excellent recommendations. The atmosphere was romantic and perfect for our anniversary dinner. Will definitely be returning!,5,Mario's Italian Bistro,Italian
"Best pizza in the city! The crust is crispy, the sauce is flavorful, and they use fresh, high-quality ingredients. The staff is friendly and the restaurant has a great casual atmosphere. Perfect for family dinners or date nights.",5,Tony's Pizza Palace,Italian
"Had high expectations but was disappointed. The food arrived cold and the service was extremely slow. We waited over an hour for our entrees. The pasta was bland and overcooked. The restaurant was also quite noisy, making conversation difficult.",2,Bella Vista,Italian
Decent food but nothing special. The chicken parmesan was okay but a bit dry. Service was adequate but not particularly friendly. Prices are reasonable for the portion sizes. It's an okay choice for a quick meal but there are better options in the area.,3,Corner Cafe,American
Outstanding seafood restaurant! The lobster was incredibly fresh and perfectly prepared. The wine selection is extensive and the sommelier was very helpful. Service was attentive without being intrusive. Expensive but worth every penny for a special occasion.,5,Ocean's Bounty,Seafood
Terrible experience from start to finish. We were seated 30 minutes late despite having a reservation. The appetizers were clearly microwaved and the main courses were tasteless. The server seemed annoyed when we asked questions. Overpriced for what you get. Will not return.,1,Downtown Diner,American
"Love this place for brunch! The pancakes are fluffy and the eggs benedict is incredible. Coffee is always fresh and hot. The staff is friendly and efficient. Only downside is it can get quite crowded on weekends, so make a reservation.",4,Sunny Side Cafe,American
"Authentic Thai flavors that remind me of my trip to Bangkok! The pad thai is perfectly balanced - not too sweet, great texture. The green curry has just the right amount of spice. Service is quick and prices are very reasonable. Hidden gem!",5,Thai Garden,Thai
"Food was good but the service needs improvement. Our server forgot our drink order and we had to ask for condiments multiple times. The atmosphere is nice and the food came out hot and fresh. With better service, this could be a 4-star experience.",3,Hillside Grill,American
Absolutely love the ambiance here - perfect for a romantic dinner. The steaks are cooked exactly as ordered and the sides are creative and delicious. Wine list is impressive. Service is professional and attentive. A bit pricey but the quality justifies it.,4,Prime Steakhouse,Steakhouse
"Disappointing visit. The sushi didn't taste fresh and the rice was too warm. Service was slow and inattentive. The restaurant was also uncomfortably warm. For the price point, I expected much better quality and service.",2,Sakura Sushi,Japanese
Great neighborhood spot! The burgers are juicy and the fries are crispy. Staff is always welcoming and remembers regular customers. Prices are fair and portions are generous. Perfect for a casual lunch or dinner with friends.,4,Local Burger Joint,American
"Incredible Mexican food! The tacos are authentic and flavorful, and the guacamole is made fresh at your table. The margaritas are strong and well-made. The mariachi band adds to the festive atmosphere on weekends. Highly recommend!",5,Casa Miguel,Mexican
"Food quality has declined recently. Used to be one of my favorite spots but the last few visits have been disappointing. Chicken was dry, vegetables were overcooked. Service is still good but the kitchen needs to step up their game.",2,Garden Fresh,American
Solid Italian restaurant with good portions and reasonable prices. The lasagna is hearty and flavorful. Service is consistent and friendly. Not fancy but reliable for a satisfying meal. Good option for families with children.,4,Nonna's Kitchen,Italian
"Worst dining experience in years. Food was cold when it arrived, server was rude and dismissive. The restaurant was dirty and poorly maintained. We left most of our food untouched. Complete waste of money and time. Avoid at all costs!",1,Fast Stop Diner,American
Excellent breakfast spot! The omelets are fluffy and packed with fresh ingredients. Coffee is outstanding and they offer many specialty drinks. Service is quick even during busy morning rush. Prices are reasonable for the quality.,4,Morning Glory Cafe,American
Decent Chinese food but nothing exceptional. Portions are large and prices are fair. The lo mein was tasty but the sweet and sour chicken was a bit too sweet for my taste. Service was adequate. Good for takeout.,3,Golden Dragon,Chinese
Beautiful restaurant with amazing views! The seafood is fresh and expertly prepared. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and wine pairings. Perfect for special occasions. Make reservations well in advance as it's quite popular.,5,Harbor View,Seafood
"Food was mediocre at best. The soup was lukewarm and the sandwich was bland. For a place that claims to be 'gourmet', I expected much more flavor and creativity. Service was friendly but couldn't make up for the disappointing food.",2,Gourmet Corner,American
